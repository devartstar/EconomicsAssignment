                    <h2>INTERNATIONAL TRADE</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Before jumping to my problem statement for the assignment I first want to discuss
                        the topic of International Trade.
                        The question of importance is that, if a country has the capability of producing goods by itself
                        then why should it be involved in International Trade?
                        The main reason is that trade promotes specialization. If a country is exporting some good then
                        it's obvious that it should have expertise in producing that good. This may include that their
                        production cost may be less or they may have abundant raw materials or labor supply for the
                        production of that good.
                        Hence specialization promotes Productivity, Employment, and overall enhancement in the Standard
                        of Living in the long run.

                    <h2>David Ricardo in 1870</h2>
                    <p class="lead">In his article on (Principle of political economy and Taxation). He said that if
                        countries trade based on specialization and free trade then it would be profitable to all the
                        nations even for the relatively inefficient country. (as the less efficient countries can focus
                        on specialization).
                        Giving rise to the principle of Comparative and Absolute Advantage.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Absolute Advantage(Directly comparing actual cost)</h4>
                    <p>Absolute advantage can be a result of a
                        country's natural endowment. (or the country exports those substances which it has in abundance
                        and
                        imports those substances which are in scarcity ) .</p>
                    <h4>Comparative Advantage(Comparing the opportunity Cost) </h4>
                    <p>Opportunity cost means how much the
                        production of the other product gets affected by the production of one product. So a country
                        must
                        import those goods whose opportunity cost as compared to other products is more and export those
                        which opportunity cost is less as compared to the other trading partner. Then the welfare of
                        both
                        will increase.</p>

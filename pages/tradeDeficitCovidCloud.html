                    <h2>Discussion on Trade Deficit under the Cloud of Covid</h2>
                    <p class="lead">India has been in trade deficits since the year 1980 which is due to the increase in
                        imports.
                        <br />
                        <strong>WHAT HAPPENED IN THE MONTH OF JUNE 2020 WHEN INDIA REGISTERING TRADE SURPLUS AFTER 18
                            YEARS.</strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>The COVID19 pandemic largely affected the exports and imports of all variety of goods all around
                        the world.</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>For the first time in over 18 years as the domestic demands decrease following the COVID19
                            pandemic which affected imports to decrease more than exports.</li>
                        <li>In the month of June, merchandise export reduced by 12.4 %.</li>
                        <li>Imports decreased by 47.6% leading to a trade surplus of $790 million</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p><strong>One of the main reasons for the decrease in the imports was the decrease in the demand
                            for crude oil resulting in a decrease in import of crude oil by 55.3 % compared to that of
                            July 2019.</strong></p>

                        What does the future hold In Post Pandemic Situation?
                    </h2>
                    <p class="lead">Due to the delayed recovery in imports in pandemic situation economists predict for
                        the merchandise trade deficit to decrease to $12 billion in the first quarter of FY2021 as
                        compared to $46 billion in the first quarter of FY2020.
                        <br /><strong>Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)</strong> has
                        estimated the
                        world economy to contract by 7% in 2020. It also excepts India’s economy to contract by as
                        much as 7.3% in the FY2021, if there is a second wave of coronavirus in the
                        country.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>To find the reason for Indias Trade Deficit we need to look into India’s Top Trading
                            Partners -</strong></p>

                    <p><strong>As of the year 2018-2019, India had a trade surplus with America is $16.85 billion but
                            there is a
                            trade deficit with China of value $53.56 billion dollars.</strong><br />
                        This is a huge amount of deficit we have with China and forces us to think about why is there a
                        surplus with the USA and a deficit with China.

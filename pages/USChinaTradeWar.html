                    <h2>What India gained between US-China Trade War?</h2>
                    <p class="lead">Since the middle of 2018’s the US and China have been barred in a trade dispute that
                        has ended on several occasions of tariffs imposed back and forth between them. First targeting
                        specific products(such as steel, aluminum, solar panels) and then specifically targeting imports
                        from China. As of mid-2018 US and China raised tariffs of about USD 50 billion worth of each
                        other goods.<br />
                        <strong>This war escalated further in September 2018 when the US introduced an additional 10%
                            tariff to cover USD 200 billion worth of Chinese Imports. To which China fought back by
                            applying tariffs on imports from the US worth an extra USD 60 billion.</strong>
                    <h6><strong>The UNCTD (UnitedNation Conference on Trade and Development) studied the advantages and
                            disadvantages of this trade war and told that none of the nations is benefited by this trade
                            war. US tariffs on China are economically hurting both countries. Due to the tariff, there
                            is more than a 25% drop in the imports in half a year.</strong></h6>

                            benefits from trade diversion. It also benefits Korea, Canada, and India by a substantial
                            amount ranging from USD 0.9 billion to USD 1.5 billion.</strong></p>

                    <h2>INDIA’S BENEFIT:-</h2>
                    <p class="lead"> India benefited an amount of 755 million USD with additional exports to the US in
                        the first half of 2019 by selling more –</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Metals and ore (USD 181 million)</li>
                        <li>Electrical machinery (USD 83 million)</li>
                        <li>Various machinery ( USD 68 million)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>However, despite the substantial tariffs due to the competitiveness of Chinese firms,
                            China remained a major contributor. Hence the learning India must take from China is to make
                            our market even more competitive.</strong></p>

                    <h2>Solutions to India's Trade Deficit</h2>
                    <p class="lead">There is no doubt that Indiaâ€™s trade deficit with China is part of a larger
                        challenge of trade competitiveness, which consists of a range of issues from domestic
                        macroeconomic imbalances to the failure to enter into global supply chains.<br />
                        Some solutions on which India can work upon are -
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>India has to rein in its domestic macroeconomic imbalance and on other hand build
                            competitive industrial capabilities.</li>
                        <li>The US-China trade war provides India with a great opportunity to mark its return in the
                            global manufacturing market as the global supply chain gets rewired.</li>
                        <li>Rising wages in China are also another factor that could work for India.</li>
                        <li>One of the largest factors is that India is losing out to its regional peer countries such
                            as Vietnam, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and the Philippines.</li>
                        <li>India has to do larger global investment projects.</li>
                        <li>The larger lesson is that such industrial projects should help India plug into global
                            supply chains, and use them as conveyor belts for exports of manufactured goods.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>India can also apply some improved quality norms and technical regulations to decrease the number
                        of imports.<br />
                        India has also applied some anti-dumping duties and countervailing duties on imported goods to
                        control the number of imports.

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p class="lead">The trend of a decrease in the trade deficit for the last few years and with India
                        walking away from the RCEP pact may lead to a decrease in trade imbalance with China. Since
                        China is the major cause of the trade deficit of India, making the Indian market more prominent
                        in the Chinese Region and avoiding the use of Chinese goods can lead to better trading numbers
                        between India and China. Making more strict regulations with respect to unacceptable trading
                        practices of imports by applying the tariffs and duties such as anti-dumping and pushing the
                        domestic market further towards specialization will eventually help in increasing the export
                        count and will help to reduce the Negative Trade Balance or Trade Deficit of India in upcoming
                        years.</p>

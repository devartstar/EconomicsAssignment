                    <h2>RCEP ( Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership )</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        It pact aimed at free trade corridor between the members so that good and services can flow
                        freely in between them. The scale of RCEP is aimed at making a game changer as it could have
                        been the world’s largest trading pact with a 1/3rd of global GDP and half of the world
                        population under it.
                        <br /><br />
                        The main initiative was given by China even though RCEP is built around ASEAN and hence has
                        major China bias in the deal. It was proposed by Beijing in 2012 in order to counter the
                        trans-pacific partner agreement.
                        But India soon chooses to walk away from RCEP. Experts were of the view that the trade barriers
                        were lifted and the Indian market would have been flooded with Chinese goods thus killing Indian
                        businesses.
                        <br /><br />
                        India’s trade deficit with RCEP countries has been huge due to a reduction of 80% to 90% of
                        goods would have meant a sweet deal for China but maybe an absolute disaster for India.
                    </p>
                    <p>The sectors of the Indian market that would have felt are</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Dairy sector</li>
                        <li>Textile sector</li>
                        <li>Marine</li>
                        <li>Chemical pharmaceuticals</li>
                        <li>Iron steel and non-ferrous metal</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>All this meant that jobs would have gone further destroyed and Indian small or middle
                            producers would have faced the Chinese market.</strong></p>

                    <p>So what was India seeking from it?</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keep Dairy, Auto, and certain textiles out of the pact</li>
                        <li>Options to stop imports or raise duties in case of sudden flooding of the market</li>
                        <li>Stricter investment regime and dispute management</li>
                        <li>Stricter ‘origin of product’ norms to curb abuse of FTA.</li>
                        <li>Change in base tariff from 2014 to 2019</li>

                    <h2>Tariffs and Duties</h2>
                    <p class="lead">
                        TARIFFS AND DUTIES TO DECREASE ARE APPLIED TO REDUCE SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITIES AND IMPORTS
                        The WTO( World Trade Organization ) imposes some duty on the trades and goods imported or
                        exported so to help some of the middle and lower economic countries so that their domestic
                        market is not destroyed by the developed countries.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>DUMPING</h4>
                            <p>It is said to take place when a company exports its product at a price that is lower than
                                the price it normally charges in its nation. A country may do this maybe due to the
                                increase in stock or something.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>ANTI-DUMPING DUTY</h4>
                            <p>It is the imposition of a levy by the importing country in order to counter the dumping
                                of products and save the domestic market. Article 6 of the GATT allowed countries to
                                take action against dumping. But in order to impose this duty, the government has to be
                                able to show that dumping is taking place by calculating the extent of dumping and show
                                that the dumping is causing damage. <br /><strong>Example</strong>- India has recently
                                imposed anti-dumping
                                duty on 99 Chinese products on January 28.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>COUNTERVAILING DUTY (CVDs)</h4>
                            <p>It is also known as anti-subsidy duties. They are used to counter the negative impact of
                                imports to protect the local producers. They are imposed after an investigation finds
                                that a foreign country subsidizes its exports It is imposed in accordance with the GATT
                                Article 6.<br /><strong>Example</strong>- On September 9, 2019 – DGTR(Directorate
                                General of Trade and
                                Remedies) concluded that Saccharin has been exported to India at a subsidized value
                                which resulted in the subsidization of the product.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h4>SAFEGUARD TARIFF</h4>
                            <p>It helps in restricting the imports of the products temporarily(cannot last more than 4
                                yrs but in certain conditions can be extended to 8 yrs) if its domestic industry is
                                threatened by the surge in imports. <br /><strong>Example</strong>- We are pushing a lot
                                towards solar energy
                                so As of 2018 about 90% of the Solar Panels was imported…so the safeguard tariff was
                                applied for 2 yrs.</p>
                        </li>

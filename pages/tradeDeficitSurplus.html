                            but the increase in the import of foreign goods in India is far more than the increase in
                            exports thus resulting in a constant increase in the trade deficit as it is visible from the

                    <p>As seen in the graph there is a
                        steep decrease in exports of these 3 major sectors which lead to an increase in the Trade
                        deficit. We also had some pickup in the exports but it failed to pick up as much as that of the
                        imports.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>What we can learn from this is the importance to gain specialization in these industry
                            and the government is also trying to impose duties so that the imports may become costlier
                            and thus the rise will decrease and people will prefer domestic products since Keeping in
                            mind the fact that imports will be volatile for one reason or the another so the clear
                            solution is that we have to pick up in the number of exports to decrease the trade
                            deficit.</strong></p>

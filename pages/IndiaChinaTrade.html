                            on India-China Trade. India has such a large trade deficit with china because 14% of India’s
                            imports
                            come from China followed by 7.5% by the USA.

                                such a
                                huge Negative Trade with China?</strong></p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Firstly</strong>, according to macroeconomics, China enjoys a huge trade surplus as
                            it saves more
                            than it invests. China has been strongly interventionist in the way it manages exchange
                            rates.
                            <br />
                            <strong>Secondly</strong>, China actively used subsidies to promote its domestic industry
                            thus giving it
                            unfair advantages in many ways (like the subsidies to the cost of production of manufactured
                            goods).<br />
                            <strong>Thirdly</strong>, There are fears of the Indian policy establishment about deep
                            links between the
                            Chinese Industrial Sector and Government in Beijing resulting in bilateral trade becoming a
                            part of a larger geostrategic dilemma.

                    <p class="lead">India halves its trade gap with China<br />
                        With the start of the new Financial Year FY21, within the first 5 months(ie.April to August)
                        India saw a huge decrease in trade deficit with China to about 5.8 billion dollars resulting in
                        a total trade deficit of 12.8 billion dollars. This is also being considered as the lowest that
                        India has touched with China in a decade.
                    </p>
                    <p><strong>So why is there a decrease in the Trade Deficit suddenly this year -</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is due to more export form Indias side (About 27% increase)</li>
                        <li>It is due to a decrease in import from China (About 27% decrease)</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><strong>Though India saw a rise in the number of exports to China but other top 5 trading
                            partners of India saw a decrease in the exports -</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Exports to the USA are down by 24.6%</li>
                        <li>Exports to the UAE are down by 59.2%</li>
                        <li>Exports to Singapore are down by 26.7%</li>

                    <h2><strong>Is this narrowing of the trade gap with china Sustainable?</strong></h2>
                    <p class="lead">Economists beliefs that this narrowing of the trade gap may not be sustainable in
                        the long run since in this current pandemic situation domestic demand is currently squeezed
                        which explains the reason for lower imports.<br />
                        Arpita Mukherjee (professor of Indian Council on International Economics Relation) said that
                        there may be rerouting of the goods taking place. China may be exporting its goods to Hong Kong
                        or Singapore and India are indirectly importing goods from them.
                        I want to bring light to another factor that might have led to such a huge trade deficit between
                        India and China.<br />
                        India initially participated in RCEP negotiations but in 2019 India walked away from these
                        negotiations.
